# HPC application usage examples

This directory tree holds a collection of examples for using various
software applications in a High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment.

The examples are written for the HPC facility at Bibliotheca Alexandrina
(ba) and therefore contain some site-specific parameters (e.g.,
partition names) but are hopefully still useful as general usage
examples.

The BA-HPC has Slurm as workload manager and Lmod as environment modules
tool.  Python software is installed via `conda`.

See documentation on the following:

- [Lmod](https://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/010_user.html)
